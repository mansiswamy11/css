My dream is to become a businesswomen, I have always beleived in the american dream & I want to own a company of my own (basically be my own boss).<br>
 My dream college is MIT as it is an amazing school and it has a acceptancy rate of 6.7, so it would truly be great if I was accepted.<br>
I have 2 sisters whos names are Aditi & Shivani (elder and younger sister). I like both of them but sometimes they are pretty abnoxious.<br>
I study in the school Gems Modern Aademy - Dubai, UAE. And yes I do live in UAE, I have lived here my entire life. But originally I am from Chennai, India.<br>
My BFF is Sahana, she is in my school she used to live in my area sadly she shifted to another community :( but we try to keep in touch.<br>
I like to travel and I haven't even entered high school yet but I already decided that when I retire I will get a big house and travel the full world.</p>
